# Perl TCP Transfer Test

Use Perl sockets to send varying size blocks of data via TCP and get timing.

As see when running client.pl with varying buffer sizes, the buffer size reported by getsockopt() remains constant.

That the buffer size is changing can be seen by comparing the runtimes with varying values for bufsz.


# Usage

## Create Test Data


Create a 10M file of uncompressible test data

```bash
dd if=/dev/urandom  bs=1024 count=20480 | gzip - | dd bs=1024 count=10240 of=testdata-10M.dat

> testdata-100M.dat
```

Now create a 100M file:

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10)
do
	cat testdata-10M.dat >> testdata-100M.dat
done
```

Create 128M file:

```bash
(dd if=/dev/urandom  bs=1M count=3000) | gzip -  | dd iflag=fullblock bs=1M count=128 of=testdata-128M.dat
```

## server.pl

Set the port with this line near the top of the script

```perl
  my $port = 4242;
```

Then just run the script:

```bash
# ./server.pl
Report Interval: 512
Initial Receive Buffer is 25165824 bytes
Server is now listening ...
Initial Buffer size set to: 2048
```

The script can also be called with a power of 2 integer to set the buffer size:

```bash
#  ./server.pl 4096
Report Interval: 256
Initial Receive Buffer is 425984 bytes
Server is now listening ...
Initial Buffer size set to: 4096
```

## client.pl

Usage for client.pl

```bash
client.pl

usage:  client.pl address port bufsz latency

client.pl --file <filename> --op-line-len N

  --remote-host  The host were server.pl is running
  --port         Port number to connect to - default is 4242
  --local-host   The local IP address to use for the outgoing connection
  --buffer-size  Size of TCP buffer - default is 8192
  --latency      Simulate latency in milliseconds - default is 0
  --h|help       Help

example: client.pl --remote-host 192.168.1.42 --localhost 192.168.1.75 --port 1999 --buffer-size 524288 --latency 24

```

Note: Client and Server cannot run on the same IP address

[Wondershaper](https://github.com/magnific0/wondershaper) was used to throttle the interface associated with 192.168.1.89.

This was to simulate the speed of a slow network connection, such as DSL

as root:

```bash

 wondershaper -a enp4s0 -u 56 -d 56

 ```

 Then run the client:


```bash

bufsz of 128000 is not a power of 2

       remote host: 192.168.1.105
              port: 4242
             bufsz: 128000
 simulated latency: 0

bufsz: 128000
 Send Buffer is 2097152 bytes
Connected to 192.168.1.105 on port 4242
Sending data...

```

Output from server:

```bash

Connection accepted from lestrade3.jks.com : 4242
New Desired Buffer Size set to 128000

Receive Buffer is 425984 bytes

# Examples of differing bufsz

Although the client is reporting the same buffersize via getsockopt(), the effects of changing bufsz can be seen in the following example:

## packet-driver.sh

Assuming there are multiple interfaces setup for testing different MTU sizes.

Call this to run a test multiple times, currently runs the tests 23 times

Call with 1500 or 9000 for the MTU size

```text
# ./packet-driver.sh  900
900
Please use 1500 or 9000
```

## packet-averages.pl

You may wish to run several tests and get some averages from the server side.

Start the server like this:

```bash
$ ./server.pl | tee mtu-9000.log
```

Then the client in a loop via `packet-driver.sh`.


Then get the averages from the resulting log file on the server side:

```text
root@ubuntu-mule-02# ./packet-averages.pl < mtu-1500.log
key/avg:          Bytes Received 1073733637.000000
